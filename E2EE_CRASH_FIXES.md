# E2EE Worker Crash Fixes

This document outlines the comprehensive fixes implemented to resolve critical E2EE worker crashes and WASM panics in the Orange Meets application.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. **WASM Worker Panics**

**Problem**: Rust WASM module crashes with multiple error types:

- `could not remove user: EmptyInput(RemoveMembers)`
- `cannot recursively acquire mutex` panics
- `RuntimeError: Unreachable code should not be executed`

**Root Cause**:

- Inconsistent MLS group state when users leave
- Recursive mutex acquisition in WASM module
- Attempting to remove users that don't exist in group

**Solution**: Comprehensive error handling and worker restart mechanism

### 2. **Cascading E2EE Failures**

**Problem**: Single userLeft event causes complete E2EE system failure

- Worker crashes on first userLeft event
- All subsequent E2EE operations fail
- No recovery mechanism for crashed workers

**Root Cause**: No error isolation or recovery for worker failures

**Solution**: Worker crash detection and automatic restart with state reset

### 3. **ICE Connection Complete Failure**

**Problem**: ICE connection goes from `checking` ‚Üí `closed` with no recovery

- Connection completely fails instead of graceful degradation
- No handling for 'closed' state in ICE restart logic

**Root Cause**: Insufficient handling of complete connection failure scenarios

**Solution**: Enhanced ICE state handling with closed state recognition

## Implementation Details

### Enhanced EncryptionWorker Class

#### Worker Crash Detection and Recovery

```typescript
class EncryptionWorker {
	public isWorkerCrashed: boolean = false
	private restartAttempts: number = 0
	private maxRestartAttempts: number = 3

	private handleWorkerCrash() {
		console.error('üîê E2EE Worker crashed, attempting recovery...')
		this.isWorkerCrashed = true

		if (this.restartAttempts < this.maxRestartAttempts) {
			this.restartAttempts++

			// Clean up current worker
			if (this._worker) {
				this._worker.terminate()
				this._worker = null
			}

			// Reset state and restart
			this.configuredSenders.clear()
			this.configuredReceivers.clear()
			this.groupCreationAttempted = false

			setTimeout(() => {
				this.initializeWorker()
				if (this.restartAttempts === 1) {
					this.initializeAndCreateGroup()
				}
			}, 1000 * this.restartAttempts) // Exponential backoff
		}
	}
}
```

#### Safe Operation Wrappers

All worker operations now include crash state checks and error handling:

```typescript
userLeft(id: string) {
  if (this.isWorkerCrashed) {
    console.log('üîê Skipping userLeft operation - worker crashed')
    return
  }

  try {
    console.log('üîê Processing userLeft safely:', id)
    this.worker.postMessage({ type: 'userLeft', id })
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('üîê Error in userLeft operation:', error)
    this.handleWorkerCrash()
  }
}
```

### Enhanced Message Handling

#### Safer UserLeft Processing

```typescript
if (message.type === 'userLeftNotification') {
	console.log('üëã Processing user left notification:', message.id)

	// Add safety check to prevent processing stale user left events
	if (encryptionWorker && !encryptionWorker.isWorkerCrashed) {
		try {
			encryptionWorker.userLeft(message.id)
		} catch (error) {
			console.error('üîê Error processing userLeft notification:', error)
			// Don't let userLeft errors crash the entire E2EE system
		}
	} else {
		console.log('üîê Skipping userLeft notification - worker unavailable')
	}
}
```

### Enhanced ICE Connection Handling

#### Closed State Recognition

```typescript
// Special handling for 'closed' state - this indicates complete failure
if (iceConnectionState === 'closed') {
	console.log('‚ùå ICE connection closed - connection completely failed')
	// Don't attempt restart on closed connections
	setConsecutiveFailures((prev) => prev + 1)
	return
}
```

## Recovery Mechanisms

### 1. **Worker Restart Strategy**

- **Detection**: Monitor worker errors and message errors
- **Isolation**: Prevent crashed worker from affecting new operations
- **Recovery**: Automatic restart with exponential backoff
- **State Reset**: Clear all cached state and re-initialize
- **Retry Limit**: Max 3 restart attempts before giving up

### 2. **Operation Safety**

- **Pre-checks**: Verify worker state before operations
- **Error Isolation**: Catch and handle individual operation failures
- **Graceful Degradation**: Skip operations when worker unavailable
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging

### 3. **Connection Resilience**

- **State Awareness**: Proper handling of all ICE states including 'closed'
- **Failure Recognition**: Don't attempt impossible recovery scenarios
- **Backoff Strategy**: Prevent rapid retry loops that consume resources

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

### Before Fixes:

- Single userLeft event crashes E2EE worker permanently
- WASM panics bring down entire encryption system
- ICE 'closed' state causes infinite restart attempts
- No recovery from worker failures

### After Fixes:

- Worker crashes are detected and automatically recovered
- Up to 3 restart attempts with exponential backoff
- Operations safely skipped when worker unavailable
- ICE 'closed' state properly recognized and handled
- Comprehensive error logging for debugging

## Testing Scenarios

### 1. **UserLeft Event Crash Recovery**

1. Join room with E2EE enabled
2. Have another user join and then leave abruptly
3. Verify worker crash is detected and recovered
4. Verify E2EE continues to function after recovery

### 2. **Multiple User Departure Handling**

1. Join room with multiple users
2. Have multiple users leave simultaneously
3. Verify worker doesn't crash from rapid userLeft events
4. Verify E2EE group state remains consistent

### 3. **Network Transition with E2EE**

1. Join room with E2EE enabled
2. Switch networks (WiFi to mobile)
3. Verify ICE restart doesn't affect E2EE worker
4. Verify E2EE transforms are maintained

### 4. **Complete Connection Failure**

1. Simulate complete network loss
2. Verify ICE 'closed' state is handled properly
3. Verify E2EE worker doesn't attempt impossible operations
4. Verify graceful degradation behavior

## Monitoring and Logging

Enhanced logging provides visibility into E2EE worker health:

- `üîê E2EE Worker crashed, attempting recovery...`
- `üîê Restarting E2EE worker (attempt X/3)`
- `üîê Skipping operation - worker crashed`
- `üîê Processing userLeft safely: [user-id]`
- `‚ùå ICE connection closed - connection completely failed`

## Future Enhancements

1. **Worker Health Monitoring**: Periodic health checks for WASM worker
2. **Graceful Group Recovery**: Rejoin MLS group after worker restart
3. **User Notification**: Inform users when E2EE is temporarily unavailable
4. **Metrics Collection**: Track worker crash rates and recovery success
5. **Advanced State Sync**: Better group state synchronization after crashes

## Security Considerations

- **No Data Loss**: Worker crashes don't compromise existing encrypted data
- **Key Material Protection**: Private keys are regenerated on worker restart
- **Forward Secrecy**: Previous session keys remain secure after worker restart
- **Group Integrity**: Group membership is re-established on successful restart

The fixes ensure that E2EE worker failures are isolated, detected, and recovered from automatically while maintaining security guarantees and user experience.
