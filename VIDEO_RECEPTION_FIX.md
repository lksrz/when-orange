# Video Reception Issue & Fix

## Issue Description

After implementing the comprehensive network transition and E2EE crash fixes, users report they cannot see video from other users' cameras while audio still works.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue appears to be caused by the **media flow monitoring** feature that was added as part of the network transition fixes. This monitoring was too aggressive and was triggering ICE restarts even when video was working normally.

### Problematic Code

```typescript
// This was checking every 5 seconds and restarting ICE after just 15 seconds of "no data"
if (noDataCount >= 3) {
	console.log('🔄 Triggering ICE restart due to no media flow')
	// This was interrupting normal video reception
}
```

## Implemented Fix

### 1. Disabled Media Flow Monitoring Temporarily

The aggressive media flow monitoring has been temporarily disabled to restore video functionality:

```typescript
// TEMPORARILY DISABLED: This might be interfering with video reception
/*
useEffect(() => {
  // Media flow monitoring code commented out
}, [peerConnection, iceRestartInProgress])
*/
```

### 2. Enhanced E2EE Error Handling

Added better error handling for E2EE receiver transforms to ensure video can be received even if encryption setup fails:

```typescript
async setupReceiverTransform(receiver: RTCRtpReceiver) {
  if (this.isWorkerCrashed) {
    console.log('🔐 Skipping receiver transform setup - worker crashed')
    return
  }

  try {
    // Setup E2EE transform
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('🔐 Failed to set up receiver transform:', error)
    console.log('🔐 Continuing without E2EE for this track to allow video reception')
    // Don't throw - allow video reception even if E2EE fails
  }
}
```

## Testing Steps

### 1. **Immediate Test**

1. Deploy the updated code
2. Join a video call with another user
3. Verify that you can see video from other participants
4. Verify that audio still works normally

### 2. **Debug Script Usage**

Copy and paste the contents of `debug-video.js` into the browser console to get detailed information about video track status:

```javascript
// Run in browser console:
window.debugVideo.debugVideoElements()
window.debugVideo.findPeerConnections()
```

### 3. **Log Monitoring**

Watch for these log patterns:

#### Expected (Good):

```javascript
[Log] 🔐 Setting up receiver transform for track: [track-id] mediaType: video
[Log] 🔐 Successfully set up receiver transform for track: [track-id]
```

#### Warning Indicators:

```javascript
[Log] 🔐 Skipping receiver transform setup - worker crashed
[Log] 🔐 Failed to set up receiver transform: [error]
[Log] 🔐 Continuing without E2EE for this track to allow video reception
```

## Next Steps

### 1. **If Video Works Now**

- The media flow monitoring was indeed the culprit
- We can implement a more intelligent version later that doesn't interfere with normal operation

### 2. **If Video Still Doesn't Work**

- Check browser console for E2EE errors
- Use the debug script to examine video track status
- May need to investigate partytracks library integration

### 3. **Future Media Flow Monitoring**

When re-implementing media flow monitoring, it should:

- Only trigger after much longer periods (30+ seconds)
- Check for actual video activity, not just raw bytes
- Have safeguards to avoid interfering with working video
- Be disabled entirely when video is flowing normally

## Potential Alternative Issues

If disabling media flow monitoring doesn't fix the video issue, other potential causes include:

1. **E2EE Worker Crashes**: Check if E2EE workers are crashing and preventing video decryption
2. **ICE Restart Timing**: ICE restarts might be happening too frequently
3. **Encoding Parameter Issues**: The encoding parameter stability management might be too restrictive
4. **Session Readiness**: The session readiness checks might be blocking video operations

## Rollback Plan

If the fixes cause other issues, the media flow monitoring can be quickly re-enabled by uncommenting the code in `app/hooks/usePeerConnection.tsx` lines ~280-350.

## Status

- ✅ **Media flow monitoring disabled**
- ✅ **E2EE error handling improved**
- ✅ **Debug script created**
- ⏳ **Testing required** - Deploy and test video reception
- ⏳ **Monitoring needed** - Watch for any side effects
