# Screen Sharing E2EE Fix Documentation

## Issue Resolved ✅ (Updated: 2025-01-24)

**IMPORTANT**: The original E2EE implementation was working correctly. The only issue was that screen sharers couldn't see their own shared screen. The fix was simple and surgical.

## Root Cause

The issue was NOT with the E2EE system itself, but with the video track selection logic in the `Participant.tsx` component. Screen sharers were trying to decrypt their own encrypted frames, which the MLS protocol correctly prevents for security reasons.

## Solution Implemented

### Screen Sharing Self-View Fix ✅

Fixed the issue where screen sharers couldn't see their own shared screen by modifying the video track selection logic in `Participant.tsx`:

```typescript
const videoTrack =
	isSelf && !isScreenShare
		? userMedia.videoStreamTrack // User's own camera (local)
		: isSelf && isScreenShare
			? userMedia.screenShareVideoTrack // User's own screen share (local)
			: pulledVideoTrack // Other users' tracks (remote/encrypted)
```

This ensures that:

- Users see their own camera feed locally (unencrypted)
- Users see their own screen share locally (unencrypted)
- Users see other participants' content via encrypted streams (properly decrypted)

## What Was NOT Broken

- ✅ E2EE encryption/decryption for other users
- ✅ Video and audio communication
- ✅ Screen sharing visibility for recipients
- ✅ MLS worker functionality
- ✅ Safety number generation
- ✅ Group management

## What WAS Broken

- ❌ Screen sharer couldn't see their own shared screen (blank window)
- ❌ Console errors: "Cannot create decryption secrets from own sender ratchet"

## Testing Results

### ✅ All Issues Fixed:

1. **Screen sharers can see their own shared screen**
2. **No MLS decryption errors in console**
3. **E2EE continues to work for all other participants**
4. **Clean console output**
5. **No impact on existing functionality**

## Key Lessons Learned

1. **Surgical fixes are better**: The issue was localized to one component, not the entire E2EE system
2. **Don't over-engineer**: The MLS protocol was working correctly by preventing self-decryption
3. **Local tracks for self-view**: Users should always see their own content via local tracks, not encrypted streams

## Files Modified (Final Fix)

- `app/components/Participant.tsx` - Fixed video track selection logic for screen sharing self-view

## Verification Steps

1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Open room with multiple users
3. Enable screen sharing
4. Verify:
   - ✅ Screen sharing works for all participants
   - ✅ Screen sharer can see their own shared screen
   - ✅ "ENCRYPTED" indicator appears
   - ✅ No console errors
   - ✅ All participants can see shared screens
   - ✅ No MLS decryption errors in console

## Production Deployment

The fix is minimal and safe for production:

- Maintains all E2EE security features
- Provides stable screen sharing
- Clean console output
- No impact on existing functionality
- Screen sharers can properly see their own shared content
